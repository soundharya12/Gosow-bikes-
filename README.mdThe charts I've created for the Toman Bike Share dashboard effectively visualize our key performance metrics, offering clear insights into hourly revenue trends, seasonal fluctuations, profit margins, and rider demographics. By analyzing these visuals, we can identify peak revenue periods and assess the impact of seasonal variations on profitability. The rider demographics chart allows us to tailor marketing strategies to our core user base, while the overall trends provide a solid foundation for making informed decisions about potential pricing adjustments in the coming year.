The charts I've created for the Gosou Bike Share dashboard effectively visualize our key performance metrics, offering clear insights into hourly revenue trends, seasonal fluctuations, profit margins, and rider demographics. By analyzing these visuals, we can identify peak revenue periods and assess the impact of seasonal variations on profitability. The rider demographics chart allows us to tailor marketing strategies to our core user base, while the overall trends provide a solid foundation for making informed decisions about potential pricing adjustments in the coming year.
